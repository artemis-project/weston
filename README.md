## **THIS IS NOT A FORK OF WESTON!!!**
This repository is strictly for use for trying to understand the code in the [compositor](https://github.com/artemis-project/weston/tree/2.0/compositor) directory. We probably won't be keeping this updated, because our main focus is the 2.0 branch, which hasn't been committed to since February. We have no intention (at the current point in time) of forking weston to use as our own compositor. This repository is strictly for educational use.

# Committing
Please don't commit code! If you want to commit something experimental, do it on a new branch. If you actually want to start development, please see [artemis-project/desiree](https://github.com/artemis-project/desiree). There will be more info there soon on how to get things set up.

As stated before, this repo is purely for trying to understand the weston example shell. Please edit the files under [compositor/](https://github.com/artemis-project/weston/tree/2.0/compositor), and either PR or just push. We want to comment the life out of those files in there. Start in the main, and figure out how things work branching off in a kind of stack trace from there. Fill out bits about certain function calls from any documentation you can find. Make sure those functions aren't implemented in another file under compositor/, and if they are, say which file, a line number, and then an explaination of what that function call does. Go into more detail for the function implementation where you find its implementation.

If you have any questions, do NOT hesitate to open an issue! This is for learning, so please help us learn by asking any and all questions!
